# 👋 Hello, visitor!

I am Klest Dedja, passionate about mathematics, my background bridges **Applied Mathematics** and **Machine Learning**. During my PhD at KULeuven under the supervision of [Prof. Celine Vens](https://kulak.kuleuven.be/~celine.vens/index.html), I specialized in **Explainable AI** for **Survival Analysis** tasks (time-to-event in the presence of partial information), with applications in healthcare (Multiple Sclerosis, kidney function, etc.).

I have explored **Random Forests** extensively, leveraging their speed and accuracy on tabular data. By exploiting their structure, I developed [**Bellatrex**](https://github.com/klestdedja/bellatrex), a toolbox designed to generate model insights for Random Forests. I have also explored the intersection of **Active Learning** and **Survival Analysis**, with findings and tested approaches shown in this little [project](https://github.com/klestdedja/AL-SA-paper-material).
You can find my PhD dissertation [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/dff3deaa-efd3-45e2-833c-e6db47d88434).

The combination of deep theoretical expertise in AI related fields, paired with 7+ years of programming has made me a strong and curious Data Scientist (assuming we agree on the meaning of this term).

🏭 Industry experience:

- I have worked at **[Predikt](https://predikt.ai/)**, a young, innovative start-up dedicated to advancing **time-series forecasting** for CFOs and finance leaders. Predikt is developing AI-driven tools that bring confidence and trust to forecasting processes, helping CFOs and finance leaders make more informed, data-backed decisions.
