# üëã Hello, visitor!

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2.5rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    I am Klest Dedja, data Scientist, mathematician, langauge nerd. My background bridges <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> During my PhD at KULeuven, I specialized in <strong>Explainable AI</strong> for <strong>Survival Analysis</strong> tasks (time-to-event in the presence of partial information), with applications in healthcare (Multiple Sclerosis, kidney function, etc.).

    I have explored <strong>Random Forests</strong> extensively, appreciating  their speed and state-of-the-art accuracy on tabular data. By exploiting their structure, I developed <a href="https://github.com/klestdedja/bellatrex"><strong>Bellatrex</strong></a>, a toolbox designed to generate model insights for Random Forests. Additionally, I have also explored <strong>Active Learning</strong> and its intersection with Survival Analysis.

  You can find my PhD dissertation <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/dff3deaa-efd3-45e2-833c-e6db47d88434">here</a>.

    The combination of deep theoretical expertise in AI related fields, paired with 7+ years of programming has made me a strong and curious Data Scientist (assuming we agree on the meaning of this term).

I am Klest Dedja, data Scientist, mathematician, langauge nerd. My background bridges **Applied Mathematics** and **Machine Learning**. During my PhD at KULeuven, I specialized in **Explainable AI** for **Survival Analysis** tasks (time-to-event in the presence of partial information), with applications in healthcare (Multiple Sclerosis, kidney function, etc.).

I have explored **Random Forests** extensively, leveraging their speed and state-of-the-art accuracy on tabular data. By exploiting their structure, I developed [**Bellatrex**](https://github.com/klestdedja/bellatrex), a toolbox designed to generate model insights for Random Forests. Additionally, I have also explored **Active Learning** and its intersection with Survival Analysis.

You can find my PhD dissertation [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/dff3deaa-efd3-45e2-833c-e6db47d88434).

The combination of deep theoretical expertise in AI related fields, paired with 7+ years of programming has made me a strong and curious Data Scientist (assuming we agree on the meaning of this term).

### üè≠ Industry experience:

- I have worked at **[Predikt](https://predikt.ai/)**, a young, innovative start-up dedicated to advancing **time-series forecasting** for CFOs and finance leaders. Predikt is developing AI-driven tools that bring confidence and trust to forecasting processes, helping CFOs and finance leaders make more informed, data-backed decisions.

### üî≠ Current Projects:

- I am maintaining a project from my PhD years, namely **[BELLATREX](https://github.com/klestdedja/bellatrex)**: an open-access [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/bellatrex/) designed to support adoption and transparency of **Random Forest** models for several prediction tasks: binary classification, regression, survival-analysis, multi-lablel classification, and multi-target regression.

  Do you like BELLATREX? I am looking for collaborators to keep improving the project and related library! If you have fresh ideas, feature requests, or are interested in contributing to new functionalities, I‚Äôd love to connect üòä.
   Keep an eye on the repository and don't forget to add a ‚≠êÔ∏è

- Another project of my PhD years involves extending [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) explanatory toolbox to time-to-event data, with a focus on explaining feature importance within a given interval of time. This project is currently being tested and refined, and is available on [GitHub: TimeSHAP](https://github.com/klestdedja/timeSHAP)

- To be released to the public once the related paper is accepted: [EDGEHOG](https://github.com/klestdedja/directionality), a tool for **automatic directionality dispersion** estimate, using a classical **Computer vision** approach.
